<h2>Adding Widget</h2>

To add the widget to your page, go to the **PASTE_THIS_INTO_UR_SITE.html** file where you will find the code :3

Make sure the URL is the EXACT same as the one in the JSON file listing all the sites.
From now on the URLs should NOT have a / at the end

EXAMPLE: 
  https://XXX.neocities.org   = CORRECT
  https://XXX.neocities.org/   = INCORRECT
  
Also please be patient! The database listing the sites takes some time to update so it may be a few minutes before the widget works after being added.
